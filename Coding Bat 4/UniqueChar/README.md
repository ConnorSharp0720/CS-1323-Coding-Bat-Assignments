# Coding Bat 4: Unique Characters

Write a method that returns true if a given String is composed of unique characters. The method should return false if any character appears multiple times. Treat space as a character.

Hint: The indexOf(char letter) and lastIndexOf(char letter) methods in the String class can be used to make this a single loop instead of a nested loop. This way of approaching the problem is more appropriate for this section (which is about using objects and methods in the Java API, not nested loops).
