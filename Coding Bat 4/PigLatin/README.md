# Coding Bat 4: Pig Latin

Pig Latin in a child's word game. It is used to conceal words from people who don't know the code. The code is simple. If the word starts with a vowel, you add "ay" to the end. So "and" becomes "anday". If the word doesn't start with a vowel, you move the consonants at the start of the word to the end and add "ay". So "nix" becomes "ixnay" and "start" becomes "artstay". You may assume that a, e, i, o, and u are the only vowels. You may also assume that the word is given in lower case.

Hint: Create a utility method called isVowel(char letter) to determine whether or not a character is a vowel. The substring() method in the String class will also help.
