# Coding Bat 4: Is Palindrome

Given a String variable, write a method that returns true if the String is a palindrome and false otherwise. The method should ignore whitespace and the case (upper or lower) of each letter.

Hint: Use the method toLowerCase to convert all letters to lowercase. Use the method replaceAll to remove all the spaces. A word is a palindrome if it is unchanged by reversing the letters. There is a reverse method in the StringBuilder class. Remember that StringBuilder objects are mutable.
