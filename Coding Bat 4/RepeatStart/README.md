# Coding Bat 4: Repeat Start

Given a String and an int n, write a method that returns a new String made of n repetitions of the first n characters of the given String. Additionally, convert all of the letters in the output to lowercase. You may assume that n is between 0 and the length of the given String (inclusive).

Hint: Convert the given word to lowercase, use the method substring to extract the first n characters, and use a for-loop to create n repetitions of the substring.
