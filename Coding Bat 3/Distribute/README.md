# Coding Bat 3: Distribute 

Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2, return an array that contains arr1.length copies of arr2. For each copy, multiply the corresponding element of arr1 times the elements of arr2.

Example: If arr1 contained {1, 2, 3} and arr2 contained {5, 6}, the result should be {5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 18}.

Hint: The length of the output array is arr1.length * arr2.length, since there are arr2.length elements for every element in arr1.
