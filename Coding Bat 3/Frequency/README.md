# Coding Bat 3: Frequency 

Given an array of integers, return a copy where every element is replaced with the number of times it appears in the array.

Example: {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1} would produce a new array containing {3, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3}.

Hint: Construct a new array to store the frequency of each element. Loop through the elements of the original array and compare each to all the other elements. Use an accumulator to track the number of times the element appears in the array. Store the final value of the accumulator in the frequency array.

Please download the template file named **Frequency**\_**Template.java**,
once downloaded please change the file name to **Frequency.java** for submission.
