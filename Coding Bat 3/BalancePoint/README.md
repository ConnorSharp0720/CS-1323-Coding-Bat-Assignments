# Coding Bat 3: Balance Point

Given an integer array, write a method that looks for an element that is equal to the sum of the elements to its left and the sum of the elements to its right. If such an element exists, return its index. Otherwise, return -1. (If multiple such elements exist, return the index of the first from the left.) For the first element of the array, define the sum of the elements to its left as 0. For the last element, define the sum of the elements to its right as 0.

Example: {1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 3} should return 3 since 1+1+3 = 5.

Hint: This requires a nested loop. One way to think about the inner loop is to consider whether each value should be added to a leftSum or a rightSum (or not, since there has to be a middle value).
