# Coding Bat 3: Common Words

Given two arrays of unique words, write a method that returns the number of words that appear in both arrays.

Example: if the two arrays contain: {"duck", "goose"} {"goose", "chicken", "heron"}, the method should return 1.

Hint: For each word in the first array, compare it to every word in the second array. Use an accumulator to track the number of words that the arrays have in common.
