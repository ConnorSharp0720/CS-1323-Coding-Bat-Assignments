# Coding Bat 2: Remove Oversize 

Given an oversize array of size words and a word to remove, write a method that returns the array with each occurrence of the given word removed. Shift the remaining words in the nonempty part of the array to the left so that each occurrence of the given word is overwritten. (Leave the words in the empty part of the array unchanged.)

Hint: To understand the test cases, note that the size (but not the capacity) of the array shrinks if removeWord appears in the array. In the first test case, for example, "up" is removed and "down" and "left" shift to the left by one element. The size of the array shrinks from 3 to 2, although the capacity is still 3. The third element is now in the empty part of the array. This element is equal to "left", but it is treated as empty space.
