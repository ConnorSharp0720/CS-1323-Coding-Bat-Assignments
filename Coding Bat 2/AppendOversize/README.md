#  Coding Bat 2: Append Oversize 

Given an oversize array with size1 elements and a second oversize array with size2 elements, write a method that returns the first array with the elements of the second appended to the end. If the capacity of the oversize array is not large enough to append all of the elements, append as many as will fit.

Hint: Do not construct a new array. Instead, modify the contents of the oversize array inside the method.


Please download the template file named **AppendOversizes**\_**Template.java**,
