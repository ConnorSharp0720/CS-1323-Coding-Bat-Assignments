# Coding Bat 2: SubArray 

Given a perfect size integer array and two integers start and end, write a method that returns a new perfect size array that contains the elements of the input array between the first occurrence of start and the last occurrence of end (inclusive). If start or end do not appear in the array, return an empty array. If the first occurrence of start is after the last occurrence of end, return an empty array.

Hint: An empty array is constructed as shown below.

int[] emptyArray = new int[0];

Empty arrays and null arrays are different. An empty array exists and has a length of 0. A null array does not exist and has no length.
