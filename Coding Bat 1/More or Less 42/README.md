#  Coding Bat 1: More or Less 42

Suppose that x is a non-negative integer. Write a method that returns true if one of the following conditions is true:

- x is a multiple of 42;
- x is one less than a multiple of 42; or
- x is one more than a multiple of 42.
Otherwise, the method should return false.

hint: The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder when one integer is divided by another. If x is a multiple of 42, this means that the remainder is 0 when x is divided by 42. Consider what the remainder will be if x is one more or one less than a multiple of 42.
