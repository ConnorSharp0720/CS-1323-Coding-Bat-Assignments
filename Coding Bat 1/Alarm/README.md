#  Coding Bat 1: Alarm

Write a method that simulates the logic of an alarm clock. The method has two inputs: an integer and a boolean. The integer represents a day of the week with 0 being Sunday, 1 Monday, 2 Tuesday, â€¦, and 6 Saturday. The boolean indicates whether the snooze button has been pressed. The method returns a String that gives the time the alarm will ring. On weekdays, the alarm rings at "8:00". On weekends, the alarm rings at "10:30". If the snooze button has been pressed, the alarm is delayed 5 minutes on weekdays and 15 minutes of weekends. Finally, the method should check for invalid day inputs. If an invalid integer is given, the method should return "invalid day".
