#  Coding Bat 1: Seven and Not Left

Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is 7 then it does not count towards the sum and all values to the left of any 7 do not count. So for example, if b is 7, then both a and b do not count. If b and c are 7, then none of the values count.

sevenAndNotLeft(1, 2, 3) → 6

sevenAndNotLeft(1, 2, 7) → 0

sevenAndNotLeft(1, 7, 3) → 3

Hint: Carefully consider the ordering of the cases.
