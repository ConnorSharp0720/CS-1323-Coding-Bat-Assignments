#  Coding Bat 1: Tens Digit

Given two non-negative integers x and y, write a method that returns true if their tens-place digits are the same. Otherwise, the method should return false. (In case you've forgotten place-value notation, consider this example: for the integer 42, 2 is in the ones place, 4 is in the tens place, 0 is in the thousands place, 0 is in the ten-thousands place, and so on.)

hint: Any digit of an integer can be extracted using the division (/) and modulo (%) operators. Each operator only needs to be used once.
